# VaultQuest

VaultQuest is a no-loss prize-saving protocol where users deposit funds in prize vaults. Instead of earning traditional interest, users stand a chance to win prizes drawn from the collective yield. This innovative approach gives users potential rewards while keeping their deposited funds intact.

## How VaultQuest Works

VaultQuest leverages tokenized vaults built on the ERC4626 standard—a modern ERC20 implementation that standardizes yield-bearing vaults. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Deposit Funds:** Users deposit into a vault using tokens such as USDC.
2. **Yield Generation:** Deposited funds are allocated to various DeFi strategies (e.g., lending/borrowing platforms, DEX liquidity, yield farming) generating yield over time.
3. **Prize Mechanism:** Instead of traditional interest, the accumulated yield is periodically converted and awarded as prizes in regular draws.
4. **Withdrawal & Claim:** Users can withdraw their deposits at any time; winners of the draws must claim their rewards.

---

## Protocol Life Cycle

1. **Deposit:** Users select a vault and deposit their funds.
2. **Yield Accrual:** The vault invests deposits in integrated DeFi protocols, accruing yield over time.
3. **Draw & Distribution:** At regular intervals, the accrued yield is converted and randomly awarded to one or more participants.
4. **Claiming Rewards:** Winners need to claim their rewards while other users maintain control over their deposits.

## User Life Cycle

- **Deposit:** Initiate participation by depositing funds in your chosen vault.
- **Accrue Yield:** Let your deposit generate yield through automated DeFi strategies.
- **Win Prizes:** Periodically, a prize draw is conducted to distribute the yield.
- **Withdrawal:** At any time, you can withdraw your principal deposit.
- **Reward Claim:** If selected, claim the prize reward as part of your yield.

## Detailed Code Overview

### VaultPage (page.js)

The `VaultPage` component is the primary interface where users interact with prize vaults:

- **State Management:**  
  Uses React hooks (`useState`) for handling modal visibility, selected vaults, search queries, and filtering by network.

- **Vault Data:**  
  The page initializes an array of vaults. Each vault has properties like name, network, APY, TVL, user count, and deposit history. For example, the "Prize DAI" vault includes a list of recent deposits.

- **Filtering and Search:**  
  Users have the ability to filter vaults based on the network (e.g., Cosmos) or search by name/token using controlled inputs.

- **Deposit Handling:**  
  When the "Deposit" button is clicked, the selected vault is stored and a deposit modal is shown. This modal enables users to deposit funds, which then update the vault’s balance, TVL, and deposit history.

- **UI Layout:**  
  The interface leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and lucide-react for icons. It also displays statistics such as total value locked (TVL), total users, and average APY in a tabbed section.
